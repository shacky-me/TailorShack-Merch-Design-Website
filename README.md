Here's a quick guide to unleashing your inner creativity on this platform:

Contributing

The platform is currently still under development, and future features are already in the works! While this initial version focuses on the design aspect and its user-intuitiveness, future plans include:
i) Implementing user authentication for saving designs, creating profiles, and potentially building a design portfolio.
ii) Integrating with print-on-demand services to allow users to easily order their custom merchandise.
